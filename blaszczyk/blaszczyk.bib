In this essay, I trace the occurrences of the word quanto to define its role and specific meaning. The analysis shows that quanto is essential to Galileo’s mathematical study of infinitesimal quantities and that it is technically defined. In the light of this interpretation of the word quanto, Evangelista Torricelli’s theory of indivisibles can be regarded as a natural development of Galileo’s insights about infinitesimal magnitudes, transformed into a geometrical method for calculating the area of unlimited plane figures.},

Moreover there is a natural isomorphic embedding into E of the semiring \{{\textbackslash}Omega\} equipped by the natural sum and product. Finally a notion of numerosity satisfying all Euclidean common notions is given, whose values are nonnegative nonstandard integers of E.

To this end, we sketch ways of measuring infinity developed at the turn of the 20th and 21st centuries that provide alternatives to Cantor’s theory of cardinal and ordinal numbers. Some of them introduce new kinds of infinite numbers, others simply define new arithmetic for Cantor’s infinite numbers. With regard to these new approaches, we argue that there are various intuitions of actual infinity which can find an adequate theory.

We also present pre-Cantorain theories of actual infinity developed within the tradition of geometrical optics. They corroborate our claim on various intuitions concerning actual infinity.},

In this paper, we developthe idea of algebraic proof further towards a purely algebraic proof of theintermediate value theorem for real polynomials. In our proof, we neither usethe notion of continuous function nor refer to any theorem of real and complexanalysis.

Clearly, such a notion of “numerosity” can agree with cardinality only for finite sets. We show that “numerosities” can be assigned to every point set in such a way that the natural Cantorian definitions of the arithmetical operations provide a very good algebraic structure. Contrasting with cardinal arithmetic, numerosities can be taken as (nonnegative) elements of a discretely ordered ring, where sums and products correspond to disjoint unions and Cartesian products, respectively. Actually, our numerosities form suitable semirings of hyperintegers of nonstandard Analysis. Under mild set-theoretic hypotheses (e.g. cov(B)=c{\textless}ℵω), we can also have the natural ordering property that, given any two countable point sets, one is equinumerous to a subset of the other. Extending this property to uncountable sets seems to be a difficult problem.},

Conway introduced a real-closed field containing the reals and the ordinals as well as a great many less familiar numbers including −ω, ω/2, 1/ω,  and ω − π to name only a few. Indeed, this particular real-closed field, which Conway calls No, is so remarkably inclusive that, subject to the proviso that numbers—construed here as members of ordered fields—be individually definable in terms of sets of NBG (von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory with global choice), it may be said to contain “All Numbers Great and Small.” In this respect, No bears much the same relation to ordered fields that the system ℝ of real numbers bears to Archimedean ordered fields.
            In Part I of the present paper, we suggest that whereas ℝ should merely be regarded as constituting an arithmetic continuum (modulo the Archimedean axiom), No may be regarded as a sort of absolute arithmetic continuum (modulo NBG), and in Part II we draw attention to the unifying framework No provides not only for the reals and the ordinals but also for an array of non-Archimedean ordered number systems that have arisen in connection with the theories of non-Archimedean ordered algebraic and geometric systems, the theory of the rate of growth of real functions and nonstandard analysis.
            In addition to its inclusive structure as an ordered field, the system No of surreal numbers has a rich algebraico-tree-theoretic structure—a simplicity hierarchical structure—that emerges from the recursive clauses in terms of which it is defined. In the development of No outlined in the present paper, in which the surreals emerge vis-à-vis a generalization of the von Neumann ordinal construction, the simplicity hierarchical features of No are brought to the fore and play central roles in the aforementioned unification of systems of numbers great and small and in some of the more revealing characterizations of No as an absolute continuum.},

	abstract = {Cantor’s theory of cardinal numbers offers a way to generalize arithmetic from finite sets to infinite sets using the notion of one-to-one association between two sets. As is well known, all countable infinite sets have the same ‘size’ in this account, namely that of the cardinality of the natural numbers. However, throughout the history of reflections on infinity another powerful intuition has played a major role: if a collection A is properly included in a collection B then the ‘size’ of A should be less than the ‘size’ of B (part–whole principle). This second intuition was not developed mathematically in a satisfactory way until quite recently. In this article I begin by reviewing the contributions of some thinkers who argued in favor of the assignment of different sizes to infinite collections of natural numbers (Thabit ibn Qurra, Grosseteste, Maignan, Bolzano). Then, I review some recent mathematical developments that generalize the part–whole principle to infinite sets in a coherent fashion (Katz, Benci, Di Nasso, Forti). Finally, I show how these new developments are important for a proper evaluation of a number of positions in philosophy of mathematics which argue either for the inevitability of the Cantorian notion of infinite number (Gödel) or for the rational nature of the Cantorian generalization as opposed to that, based on the part–whole principle, envisaged by Bolzano (Kitcher).},
