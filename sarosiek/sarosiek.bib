	abstract = {The importance of Schrodinger’s formulation, with its stress on the generation 
of order, seems to me to derive from two crucial implications. First, in invoking 
the notion of entropy, which in statistical mechanics is fundamental to the Second 
Law of Thermodynamics, it authenticates that life conforms to the basic laws of 
physics (Ling 1934). Secondly, since negative entropy is closely coupled with the 
notion (or, more accurately, a notion) of information -  that which ‘embodies, 
expresses, and often specifies order’ (Medawar \& Medawar 1983, p. 205) -  it 
demonstrates the salience of semiotics to an understanding of life. Schrodinger 
himself (1946, p. 79) hinted at the latter when he remarked on the power of a 
group o f atoms -  he called them a ‘tiny central office’ -  to produce ‘orderly 
events’ in the isolated cell, and then went on to ask: ‘do they not resemble stations 
of a local government dispersed through the body, communicating with each 
other with great ease, thanks to the code that is common to all of them?’.},

After completing his studies in zoology at Dorpat (now Tartu, Estonia) he worked at the Institute of Physiology of the University of Heidelberg and at the Zoological Center in Naples. In 1907 he was given an honorary doctorate by the University of Heidelberg for his studies in the field of muscular physiology. His later work was devoted to the problem of how living beings subjectively perceive their environment and how this perception determines their behavior. He developed a specific method which he termed “Umwelt-research.” In 1926 Uexküll founded the Institute of Umwelt-Research at the University of Hamburg. He died on the island of Capri, Italy in 1944.},

It includes his formal statement of the influential law of effect, which has a significant impact on other behaviorists. Hull's law of primary reinforcement was closely related to the law of effect and Skinner acknowledged that the process of operant conditioning was probably that described in the law of effect."

It complements the traditional biological sciences concerned with the analysis of living organisms by attempting to synthesize lifelike behaviors within computers and other artificial media. By extending the empirical foundation upon which biology is based beyond the carbon-chain life that has evolved on Earth, Artificial Life can contribute to theoretical biology by locating "life as we know it" within the larger picture of "life as it could be." This book - proceedings of the First Interdisciplinary Workshop on the Synthesis and Simulation of Living Systems - introduces the field of Artificial Life, reviews its biological roots, discusses its goals and methodological approaches, and gives examples of modeling technologies and their application to the simulation of specific biological phenomena. It draws comparisons with similar "bottom-up" approaches to the understanding of complex systems as studied in fields such as Physics, Computer Science, and Artificial Intelligence. The book also contains an extensive annotated bibliography of more than 500 citations of work relevant to the field of Artificial Life. -- from back cover.},

	doi = {10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00058},
	abstract = {The most exciting hypothesis in cognitive science right now is the theory that cognition is embodied. Like all good ideas in cognitive science, however, embodiment immediately came to mean six different things. The most common definitions involve the straight-forward claim that “states of the body modify states of the mind.” However, the implications of embodiment are actually much more radical than this. If cognition can span the brain, body, and the environment, then the “states of mind” of disembodied cognitive science won’t exist to be modified. Cognition will instead be an extended system assembled from a broad array of resources. Taking embodiment seriously therefore requires both new methods and theory. Here we outline four key steps that research programs should follow in order to fully engage with the implications of embodiment. The first step is to conduct a task analysis, which characterizes from a first person perspective the specific task that a perceiving-acting cognitive agent is faced with. The second step is to identify the task-relevant resources the agent has access to in order to solve the task. These resources can span brain, body, and environment. The third step is to identify how the agent can assemble these resources into a system capable of solving the problem at hand. The last step is to test the agent’s performance to confirm that agent is actually using the solution identified in step 3. We explore these steps in more detail with reference to two useful examples (the outfielder problem and the A-not-B error), and introduce how to apply this analysis to the thorny question of language use. Embodied cognition is more than we think it is, and we have the tools we need to realize its full potential.},

	abstract = {In 1891 the American chemist and philosopher Charles Sanders Peirce published five articles in The Monist which in many ways anticipates present day paradigmatic discussions of science. They also present an evolutionary cosmology which, as I shall try to show, fits well into modern scientific conceptions. Thus in ’The Architecture of Theories’ we can find the following: “Uniformities are precisely the kind of fact that need to be accounted for. That a pitched coin should sometimes turn up heads and sometimes tails calls for no particular explanation; but if it shows heads every time, we wish to know how this result has been brought about. Law is par excellence the thing which wants a reason. Now the only possible way of accounting for the laws of nature and the uniformity in general is to suppose them results of evolution. This supposes them not to be absolute, not to be obeyed precisely. It makes an element of indeterminacy, spontaneity, or absolute chance in nature” (Peirce, 1955 [1891], p. 318). Peirce in this section goes on to launch an attack on Herbert Spencer’s ideas of evolution based on mechanical principles. Among other things he points out, that “exact law obviously never can produce heterogeneity out of homogeneity” and that “the law of conservation of energy is equivalent to the proposition that all operations governed by mechanical laws are reversible; so that an immediate corollary from it is that growth is not explicable by those laws, even if they be not violated in the process of growth” (ibid.).},
